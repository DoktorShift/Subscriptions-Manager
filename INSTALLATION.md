## Current Availability

Subscriptions Manager is currently available on **TimeCatcher**, our private community LNbits server.

### How to Get Access

1. **Request access** at [TimeCatcher Access](https://v1.lnbits.de/events/7GGGbKTjxWwor7sTFpEdun)
2. **Complete the Lightning payment** to unlock your spot
3. **Receive your login credentials** and start using Subscriptions Manager

Once you're in, the extension is ready to use — no additional setup required.

> Your payment supports ongoing development and keeps the community server running.

## Coming Soon: Vetted Extension

We're working to get Subscriptions Manager vetted as an official LNbits extension.

Once vetted, the extension will be:

- **Available on every LNbits instance** — Install it on your own self-hosted LNbits
- **One-time payment** — Purchase once, use forever on your instance
- **Supporting the ecosystem** — Payments support the developers and LNbits project

### How Vetted Extensions Work

```
Any LNbits Instance (self-hosted or hosted)
    │
    └── Manage Extensions → Paid Extensions
            │
            └── Find "Subscriptions Manager"
                    │
                    └── One-time Lightning payment
                            │
                            └── Extension unlocked on YOUR instance
```

> We'll update this page when the vetted extension becomes available. For now, [request access to TimeCatcher](https://v1.lnbits.de/events/7GGGbKTjxWwor7sTFpEdun) to get started immediately.

## After Installation

Once you have access to the extension, verify it's working:

- **Subscriptions Manager** appears in your LNbits sidebar
- Extension page loads without errors
- Wallet dropdown appears at the top

**Not seeing it?**

1. Refresh your browser
2. Check that the extension is enabled in Manage Extensions
3. Clear browser cache if needed

---

## Optional: On-Chain Payments

Want to accept on-chain Bitcoin in addition to Lightning? You'll need:

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **WatchOnly** | Provides your on-chain wallet (xpub/zpub) |
| **SatsPay** | Creates unified BIP21 invoices |

Both are available in the LNbits extension manager.

---

## Optional: Stripe & PayPal

> **Note:** Stripe and PayPal require **admin-level configuration** on the LNbits instance. These credentials are sensitive and can only be set once per server by the instance administrator.

**This means:**
- On TimeCatcher: Stripe/PayPal are **not available** (shared hosted instance)
- On your own LNbits: You control the admin settings

**Want fiat payments?** Wait for the vetted extension, then run it on your own self-hosted LNbits server where you have admin access to configure Stripe/PayPal credentials.
