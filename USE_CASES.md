# What Can You Do With This?

You want to get paid regularly for something you offer. That's it.

This extension lets you create subscription plans and share a simple link. When someone clicks it, they subscribe and pay you automatically - every week, month, or year.

No coding. No complicated setup. Just create, share, get paid.

## Who Is This For?

**Content Creators**
You make videos, podcasts, newsletters, or art. You want supporters to pay monthly instead of one-time tips. Create a "Supporter" plan, share the link, and your fans subscribe.

**Communities & Memberships**
You run a Discord server, private forum, or members-only group. Charge monthly access. When someone subscribes, you get notified. When they cancel, you know to remove access.

**Freelancers & Consultants**
You offer ongoing services—coaching calls, maintenance, advisory hours. Instead of chasing invoices every month, your clients subscribe once and payments happen automatically.

**Small Software Products**
You built something useful - a tool, a bot, a service. Charge a monthly fee. The extension handles billing, you handle building.

**Anyone With Recurring Value**
If you provide something valuable on a regular basis, you can charge for it on a regular basis.

## What You Get

### Predictable Income
Know what's coming in each month. See your active subscribers, track revenue, plan ahead.

### Less Admin Work
No chasing payments. No manually sending invoices. Subscribers pay automatically when their period renews.

### Flexibility for Your Customers
They can use Bitcoin (Lightning or on-chain), credit card, or PayPal - whatever's available on your server. They manage their own subscription through a self-service portal.

### Stay Informed
Get notified when someone subscribes, when a payment fails, or when someone cancels. Email, Telegram, or custom webhooks—your choice.

### Offer Trials
Let people try before they commit. Set a 7-day trial and they only pay if they stick around.

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Premium Newsletter

**What you offer:** Weekly investment insights via email

**Your plan:**
- Name: "Weekly Alpha"
- Price: 21,000 sats/month (~$10)
- Trial: 7 days free

**How it works:**
1. You create the plan
2. Share the subscribe link in your free newsletter
3. Readers click, enter their email, pay with Lightning
4. They get access, you get notified
5. Every month, they pay automatically

### Example 2: Private Community

**What you offer:** Access to a members-only Discord with trading signals

**Your plan:**
- Name: "Signals Room"
- Price: 50,000 sats/month (~$25)
- Grace period: 3 days

**How it works:**
1. You create the plan
2. Put the link on your website
3. When someone subscribes, you manually add them to Discord
4. When someone cancels or payment fails, you remove them
5. The 3-day grace period means you don't kick people out immediately if their wallet is temporarily empty

### Example 3: Monthly Coaching

**What you offer:** One 30-minute call per month

**Your plan:**
- Name: "Monthly Coaching"
- Price: 100,000 sats/month (~$50)
- No trial (you're selling your time)

**How it works:**
1. You create the plan
2. Send the link directly to interested clients
3. They subscribe, you schedule calls
4. Payments happen automatically each month
5. If they want to pause for a month, they can—you have pause/resume controls

## The Basics in 60 Seconds

1. **Create a plan** - Give it a name, set a price, pick an interval (weekly/monthly/yearly)

2. **Copy the link** - Every plan has a unique subscribe URL

3. **Share it** - Put it on your website, email signature, social media, wherever

4. **Get paid** - When someone subscribes, you receive payments directly to your LNbits wallet

5. **Manage subscribers** — See who's active, who needs attention, who cancelled

That's the whole thing.

## What You Don't Have to Worry About

- **Payment processing** — LNbits handles it
- **Invoicing** - Automatic
- **Reminding subscribers** - Automatic renewal notifications
- **Technical integration** - Unless you want to (there's an API for that)
- **Customer accounts** - Subscribers don't need to create accounts anywhere

## Before You Start

You need:
- A LNbits instance (self-hosted or on a shared server)
- This extension installed
- A wallet in LNbits to receive payments

Optional but recommended:
- Email setup for notifications (yours and subscribers')
- A clear idea of what you're offering and what it's worth

## One More Thing

This isn't about features. It's about getting paid for the value you provide, without the friction.

Create a plan. Share a link. Get paid.

That's what you can do here.
